# tensorFlowSalesAnalysisTool

This was my attempt at the assignment and I consider it complete up to level 2.
I decided to throw myself into the deepend. I built the program using Python
despite my limited knowledge of Python and Tensorflow which I had no previous interactions with.

I followed the tutorials on the TensorFlow website. Specifically https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/csv
I ran into some issues trying to get my data to interact in the same way. I decided to strip it 
down to just the absolute basics so I can confirm some interaction is working correctly. After
ensuring I had some the Machine Learning Model reading some data. I found a chat bot interface
that also used TensorFlow. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t933Gh5fNrc was the tutorial and
https://github.com/abhisarahuja/create_chatbot_using_python/tree/main was the source code.
I still have a limited understanding of how the technology full works. But I hope this demonstrates
my ability to pick up and start learning any technology I'm given. I learned a lot about machine
learning and feel closer to being able to implement in meaningfully in other projects I might do.
